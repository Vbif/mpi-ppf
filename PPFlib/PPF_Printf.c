/* This is were all the Fortran to C poratbility problems live.
 * Three issues:  what do Fortran external names look like?
 * How are strings passed?  How do we convert Fortran communicators
 * to C communicators?
 * First issue was addressed by MPICH, and we've adopted their
 * solution: figure it out with a configure script and use macros.
 * Second issue seems to work OK with linkage below on all
 * systems tested so far, though I've heard Crays do things
 * differently.  I don't have one to try out.
 * Third issue is toughest.  MPI-2 will add MPI_Comm_f2c, which
 * does the conversion we want.  If that's not available, we
 * have two choices (so far): assume no conversion is needed,
 * or convert using MPICH's MPIR_ToPointer function.  This is
 * only needed on MPICH-based systems that have 64-bit pointers.
 * (DEC's MPI is an example).  So configure script tests for
 * these characteristics and sets flags as appropriate.

/* Tested and works on:
	IBM MPI (PSSP 2.2 and 2.3)
	MPICH 1.1 on IBM 
	DEC native and MPICH 1.1 (Digital Unix 4.0B)
		-DEC native requires MPIR_ToPointer and FORTRANUNDERSCORE
		-DEC MPICH 1.1 sets FORTRANUNDERSCORE automatically in mpicc
	Meiko MPICH 1.0.13 uses FORTRANUNDERSCORE, pointers are 32-bit

/* Complicated tricks for converting communicators:  if we have

 * direct copy if either 1) we're using MPICH 1.1 or later or
 * 2) we're using an older MPICH and pointers are 32 bits.  If
 * this is old MPICH and pointers are big, we call MPIR_ToPointer.
 * If we don't have that, we just guess that a direct copy is OK
 * because we have no other choice.
